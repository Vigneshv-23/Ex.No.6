## Aim  
Write and implement Python code that integrates with multiple AI tools to automate the task of interacting with APIs, comparing outputs, and generating actionable insights using multiple AI tools.  

---

## AI Tools Required  
- ChatGPT (OpenAI API)  
- Claude (Anthropic API)  
- Bard (Google API)  
- Cohere Command API  
- Meta LLaMA API (optional)  
- Python 3.x environment with `requests` or `openai` library  

---

## Explanation  
In this experiment, we use the **persona pattern** where the AI is asked to act as a programmer to generate Python code. The experiment demonstrates how multiple AI tools can:  
1. Generate code for the same programming task.  
2. Compare outputs and analyze differences.  
3. Provide insights on code efficiency, readability, and accuracy.  

The chosen application is **data analysis and visualization**, a domain of interest for automating insights from datasets.  

---

## Experiment Steps  

1. **Define Persona Prompt**: Ask AI to act as a Python programmer and write code for a specific task (e.g., reading a CSV file, plotting graphs).  
2. **Generate Code from Multiple AI Tools**:  
   - Input the same persona prompt into ChatGPT, Claude, and Bard.  
3. **Execute Python Code**: Run the code generated by each tool in a Python environment.  
4. **Compare Outputs**:  
   - Check if code executes successfully.  
   - Compare accuracy, readability, and efficiency of generated code.  
5. **Analyze Results**: Discuss how different AI tools approached the same problem and the quality of generated solutions.

## Prompt Example  

*"Act as a Python programmer. Write Python code to read a CSV file containing sales data, calculate total sales per product, and generate a bar chart to visualize the results. Use Pandas and Matplotlib libraries."*  

---

## Sample Output  

**ChatGPT Output:**  
```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Read CSV file
data = pd.read_csv('sales_data.csv')

# Calculate total sales per product
total_sales = data.groupby('Product')['Sales'].sum()

# Plot bar chart
total_sales.plot(kind='bar')
plt.title('Total Sales per Product')
plt.xlabel('Product')
plt.ylabel('Sales')
plt.show()

Claude Output:

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load sales data
df = pd.read_csv('sales_data.csv')

# Aggregate sales by product
sales_summary = df.groupby('Product')['Sales'].sum().reset_index()

# Plotting
plt.bar(sales_summary['Product'], sales_summary['Sales'])
plt.title('Sales per Product')
plt.xlabel('Product')
plt.ylabel('Total Sales')
plt.show()


Bard Output:

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Reading the CSV file
df = pd.read_csv('sales_data.csv')

# Summarizing sales
summary = df.groupby('Product')['Sales'].sum()

# Visualization
summary.plot(kind='bar')
plt.title('Sales Summary by Product')
plt.ylabel('Sales Amount')
plt.xlabel('Product Name')
plt.show()
```

## Observations:

All AI tools produced functional Python code for the same task.

Minor differences exist in syntax and code structure, but the outputs were consistent in results.

The persona pattern helps guide AI to produce domain-specific code efficiently.

## Conclusion

The experiment demonstrates that Python code can be generated and executed successfully across multiple AI tools, with slight variations in style and structure. Using multiple AI tools provides a way to compare coding approaches, enhance code quality, and gain actionable insights for automating tasks.

## Result

The corresponding prompt was executed successfully, and the code from all AI tools produced correct outputs.
